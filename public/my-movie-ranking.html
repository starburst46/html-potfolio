<h1>The Best Movies According to Monik</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>
  "The Matrix" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic
  excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting.
  It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of
  reality, and ends with a shoot-out.<br />
  We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with
  automatic weapons fire.<br />
</p>
<h3>Dune: Part Two</h3>
<p>
  The word that will likely be used most often to describe Denis Villeneuve’s
  “Dune: Part Two” is “massive.” Expect a whole lot of variations on the words
  “epic” and “spectacle” too.<br />
  Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not
  approach Frank Herbert’s beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations, and
  it’s his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople
  with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to
  the Oscar-winning 2021 film.<br />
  While that beloved blockbuster often felt like half a film, “Dune: Part Two”
  locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough
  humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the
  old-fashioned storytelling.<br />
  More than a simple savior or chosen one story, “Dune: Part Two” is a robust
  piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can
  be done with artistry and flair.<br />
</p>
<h3>Superman: The Movie</h3>
<p>
  The first time we see Superman in his red, blue and yellow uniform is nearly
  an hour into "Superman." Perhaps the filmmakers agreed with Spielberg's famous
  statement that "Jaws" would work better the longer he kept the shark off the
  screen.<br />
  That means the film doesn't open like most superhero movies or James Bonds
  with a sensational pre-title sequence.<br />
  To be sure, it opens on the planet Krypton with his father Jor-El preparing
  him to be launched into space. But those aren't action scenes; they provide
  weight to the origin story every superhero requires.<br />
